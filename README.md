## Solution Coding Process

To solve the use case for the test, the first thing I did was read the document with Test Guidelines to download and install what was necessary to replicate the article according to the allowed technologies. After that, I started to create the files (HTML, CSS and ReadMe) and folder system and start to create the code in order.
<br /><br />
The next thing was to read and understand the challenge to analyze each of the components in the slides, divide them into the most relevant sections (NavBar, Article, Subscribe Section and Footer) and search the list of components in the Bootstrap documentation to identify which ones they were the most suitable to implement according to the use, presentation, content, responsive behavior, etc.
<br /><br />
Then, I searched the Bootstrap documentation for the components I identified in the slides to copy the sample base code into the .HTML file that best fit the slides in the document. When I finished adding the base components, I started adding the elements of the slides in their corresponding component. At this point I started modifying and adjusting the styles of each component in the .CSS file to replicate them as closely as possible to the example slides.
<br /><br />
Finally I ended up adapting some components (for example NavBar) to the different types of screen and documenting the process in the ReadMe file to verify the compliance of the deliverables.
